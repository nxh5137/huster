# _Frankenstein_ Variorum Reflection
## Introductory
Before I begin, I never had experience with Variorum, but I had experience reading _Frankenstein_.
I read the novel for the first time around Halloween in high school, and then reading a graphic novel for a class in my senior year.
We were not allowed to take the graphic novels outside of classe due to limited copies, so my teacher posted a .pdf of the graphic novel online.
When I was trying to look for a reference in the online version, I noticed that one of the speech bubbles was different from the one I have read in class, and I wondered how it was possible since they were the same story.

Jump forward to college and my professor shows us something called a Variorum Viewer.
What it does is show you the different versions of a piece of literature throughout the years.
The Variorum she shows our class just so happens to be _Frankenstein_, which just a few weeks prior I compared to _Pride & Prejudice_, which you can find under my [Corpus Analysis Assignment](https://nxh5137.github.io/huster/CorpusAnalysisAssignment).
My professor assigned us a project where we need to take note of things we found interesting in the viewer throughout the different versions.
the viewer shows the manuscript, 1818, Thomas copy, 1823, and 1831 version of _Frankenstein_.
For the assignment, I have decided to use the 1831 version of the novel since it was the last version Mary Shelley revised, and compare that version to the many different versions of the novel.
