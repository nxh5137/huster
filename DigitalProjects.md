# Digital Projects

## Raspberry Pi
 have worked on a raspberry since I was in high school when they gave it to me so I can teach the teachers things that they could do with it.
 So far I have made it an entertainment center that can play both movies and games, manage to code some music with it, as well make a voice kit that acts that a Google home, which you can see here.

 ## Car Modifications
 Earlier this year, when I got a used car, it did not have a backup camera, so I have ordered a backup camera and installed a screen up front, bringing it to the modern-day… 
 as long as you look at it on the inside.
 
 ## Amazon Firestick
 Before I had a job, I use to upgrade my mom’s coworkers Firestick for a small price,
 it didn’t stop at them though, but I soon ended up doing it for family and friends soon after.
 
 ## Ham Radio Operator
 While not as digital as the others on this list,
 I thought I would bring up how I am a Ham radio operator and been wondering how to progress since I only have an amateurs license.

## Adobe
I am familiar with photoshop, illustrator, and premiere pro.
Below are some projects I have made with Adobe.
