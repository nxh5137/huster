# Corpus Analysis Assignment

## Introduction
In my DIGIT class, we have to analyize two pieces of literature to each other.
I chose to analyize _Frankenstein_ by Mary Shelley, as well _Pride & Predujice_ By Jane Austen.
I chose these two because they were both written by women in the 19th century, and I wanted to see if there were any similarities or differences from these two.
For this project, I used _Voyant_ and _AntConc_ to see which words were frequently used in these both pieces of literature.

## Findings in AntConc
I put both pieces of literature into a .txt file and plugged them both into _AntConc_ with an N-Gram size of a Minimum of 2 and a maximum of 4.
When both were placed into _AntConc_ together, some of the words that were most frequently used in both stories were 'of the', 'in the', and 'to be' as we can see in picture 1.
I then looked at both pieces on their own, starting with _Pride & Predujice_, I found that the words most frequently used are the same as the sentence before, which you can see in picture 2.
When I plugged in _Frankenstein_ on it's own, only 'of the' was the only one in the sentences before that appears frequently, which you can see in picture 3.

## Findings in Voyant Tools
As mentioned in the introduction, I used _Voyant Tools_ for this project as well, and my findings were more interesting there than in _AntConc_.
I found that there are similarities between the two pieces of literature that are not just generic words that could be found in another piece of literature.
In an item list of 20, one of the most frequently used words that appear in both books are 'Elizabeth' as you can see in the picture below.
As well as that, in the cirrus chart, many common words can be seen within the chart, like 'father', 'shall', 'great', etc.
