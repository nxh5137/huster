# _Frankenstein_ Variorum Reflection
## Introductory
  Before I begin, I never had experience with Variorum, but I had experience reading _Frankenstein_.
I read the novel for the first time around Halloween in high school, and then reading a graphic novel for a class in my senior year.
We were not allowed to take the graphic novels outside of classe due to limited copies, so my teacher posted a .pdf of the graphic novel online.
When I was trying to look for a reference in the online version, I noticed that one of the speech bubbles was different from the one I have read in class, and I wondered how it was possible since they were the same story.

  Jump forward to college and my professor shows us something called a Variorum Viewer.
What it does is show you the different versions of a piece of literature throughout the years.
The Variorum she shows our class just so happens to be _Frankenstein_, which just a few weeks prior I compared to _Pride & Prejudice_, which you can find under my [Corpus Analysis Assignment](https://nxh5137.github.io/huster/CorpusAnalysisAssignment).
My professor assigned us a project where we need to take note of things we found interesting in the viewer throughout the different versions.
For the assignment, I have decided to use the 1831 version of the novel since it was the last version Mary Shelley revised, and compare that version to the many different versions of the novel.

## Interesting Moments
  Something I noticed that I thought was interesting while reading the Variorum was that manuscript version was missing when I went to compare the first six sections of the other editions of the novel.
However, in sections 7-10, some parts of the manuscript can be seen and compared to the other versions of the novel if you look at a version other than the manuscript.
One thing I did notice when comparing the manuscript version to the other versions was that it still was going through the editing process, with words being crossed out or being added.
An example of this is the screenshot below where both words are crossed out and being added, as well as that, if you were to look at the comparison you can see that the changed it in the other versions to "into".

  Another thing I noticed that I thought was interesting can be found in the 1831 version of the novel.
At the bottom of section 4, in the final paragraph, it is much longer than the other versions.
As can be seen in the screenshot below, in the previous versions, it is "Remember me to all my English friends," while in the 1831 version, it is completely different as well as an entire paragraph. 
It may be worth noting that this is the final version that was revised by the author, and changed things since her first draft.

  In Section 4 of the Thomas paragraph, I noticed something in the first paragraph.
As I compared the Thomas version to the different version, I noticed that it is the only one that has any changed.
For example, the previous versions and the 1831 say "expected. No," but only in the Thomas version, there is a sentence added in between.

## Final Thoughts
  The variorum was easy to navigate since all you have to do is choose a version of the novel and a section to read it in.
I thought that the missing version of the manuscript took away from the experience of the variorum, but if it had to be taken out because to much was being crossed out or to many things were being added, I could forgive it. 
I also found it interesting to see the different versions of _Frankenstein_ through the years and how they have changed.
The manuscript, Thomas, and 1831 version all had changes to them, either deleting adding things to each version.
I found the 1831 version to be the most interesting since it is also the final version of the novel, and some things were cut from previous versions, like the Thomas version, and changed the wording so that it changes the meaning of what it said in previous versions.
