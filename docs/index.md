Allow me to introduce myself, my name is Nathan Huster. 
I am currently in my second year at Penn State Behrend as both a student and an employee.
Currently, I am undecided about what I want to do in the future since the possibilities are almost endless.
I like to write, read, learn, build computers, and fix laptops. 
In the future, I hope to do many projects, whether it is writing a book or creating a game.

I will be discussing digital projects I have done in the past and what I am currently working on.

Also, I will have a resume in case anyone is interested.
