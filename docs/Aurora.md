## [_Aurore_](https://reverie-forge.itch.io/aurore)

![aurore pic](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34407859/101702164-5a31b800-3a4e-11eb-97f2-9acce1e08ef9.png)

_Aurore_ is a much different than Encodya, so if you were not fond of that you might want to give this one a try. 
It is not a long, should only take you about 30 minutes to complete.
It was made by only nine students in only two and a half months, and that is pretty impressive for obvious reasons I will be discussing, so stick around.

### Overview

While on a train ride, a person starts dreaming of another world.
You play as her dream self who looks as if she is leaving some sort of rave.
She really does stick out like a sore thumb, but it does benefit the game in this case in contrast of the light pink background.
You explore the world quite linear, which looks like a model train set frozen at the moment Godzilla showed up.
That being said, you can branch out a little and get collectibles.

-The world of _Aurore_

In this game, you get around by changing the size of certain objects.
How do you know what can be changed, simple really, It will be highlighted blue.
You can change the size by holding the right/left mouse button.
The object you are changing can only become so big/small, so no hopes in trying to change the size of Mount Everest to the size of an atom.
As you progress through the game, some of the objects are spring loaded or change weight when you change the size.

-Objects that can be changed

Besides those objects, you can collect things called memories.
These look like as though they were created with shattered stain glass by a five year old with tape.
Some are quite easy to find, but a bit out of the way, whereas others I couldn'tget to without getting a slap on the wrist for wanting to explore more.
I was not dedicated enough to go out of my way to get them because the frame rate drop faster than an art exhibit in an M5 earthquake and made the 3D platforming almost abysmal.
I am willing to forgive this though since my computer is ~5 years old running on parts older than the day I built it.

-Memory

The game does not talk about real problems because it does not need to.
The whole point is that it is a dream, an escape from the real world.
The game is aware that it's a dream, since at the beginning and the end of the game, you are awake in the real world.
A little easter egg is that if you pause the game, you blink into the real world still on the train and fade back after you resume the game.

While I am aware that a called the game not that complex, the world-building is very subtle.
While you explore the world, you notice that the world has let gravity, from the characters movement to objects that are floating.
You may not take notice in it if you are playing casually your first playthrough, you might notice why your second after your second playthrough because you know how it ends.
If you know anything about space, then they ending will make sense.
At the end you notice that the moon is bigger than normal and you need to shrink it and once you do, the water levels start to lower revealing a building.

### Final Thoughts

The game is definetly an interesting game that takes up a big spot normally reserved for my plans in life and things I've studied for.
It has lead me to ask questions that I didn't ask in games such as _Encodya_, because not a single word is spoken.
Some questions include who is the girl, why is the church upside down, and a question that every game within a dream, was it a dream?
It is like the mechanics of [_Superliminal_](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1049410/Superliminal/) and the 3d platforming of _Banjo Kazooie_ were combined.
The mechanics were fun to play around with and was visually appealing, nothing that would make me ask which was real, but enough to say it looks good.
It is also the perfect length, short enough to play if you are on a train ride, and not long enough to get bored with the mechanics.

However, the frame rate was low and I would miss the jump because I was still trying to figure out where I was going to land with the frames messing with me.
I probably would've speed ran it in 20 minutes or something if it weren't for that.
Overall, I would like to congratulte the small team of developers for creating this game.
