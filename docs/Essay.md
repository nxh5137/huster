# Using GitHub and WordPress

  When I was using GitHub, I noticed a lot of challenges to newcomers since it is hard to navigate the website, and when typing your post, the layout may look a bit frightening since it looks like you would be coding.
An advantage would be that there is a community that can help if you have any problems.
The challenges in the layout are that it is hard to figure out if you are new and trying to read the GitHub menus can be confusing since it is not straight forward with the menus.
The skills necessary for this are being able to write as well as understanding how to write in markdown.

When I was using WordPress, everything was easy to use, to use, from writing posts to picking the background I wanted to use, so it would be easy for any newcomer to pick up and use.
WordPress does not depend on knowing how to code or know the layout, it is straight forward, all you need to do is type your entry.
While easy to use, it is possible to get lost in the first few minutes if you do not know what everything means because tutorials can be found online and not on the site itself.
The skills necessary to use WordPress are knowing how to read and write mainly since there is no reason to code.
A skill I would like to improve would be to organize it better since my posts seem to be all over the place.
