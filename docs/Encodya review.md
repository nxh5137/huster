## [_Encodya Demo_](https://chaosmonger.itch.io/encodya)

![encodya](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34407859/101263142-1ae32e80-3711-11eb-8bdf-4fd620634eef.jpg)

_Encodya_ is what happens when you let early _Lucasarts_ make _Blade Runner_ instead of the _Monkey Island_ games. 
It is made by an Indie studio called [_Chaosmonger Studio_](http://www.chaosmonger.com/), known for making movies, always good to branch out, but it all comes down to if it is good.
At the time of writing this, only the demo was available, but it is suppose to be released on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1137450/Encodya/) and [Gog.com](https://www.gog.com/game/encodya) on January 26, 2021.
So this review is only what the demo has to offer, is it unfair to judge something by 30 minutes, maybe but I need a grade.

### Overview

You play as a young orphaned girl and her robot caregiver in Neo-Berlin, 2062.
The world is very similar to Philip K. Dick's popular works, but is really eyeing _Blade Runner_ in particular.
You have to find a way to get a bus ticket in the place the last bus dropped you off at.
How would you do this you might ask, simple, you make the little girl collect a fingerprint from a nearby criminal.
You also need to fish a credit card from the sewer, and this is the only time I can say I got stuck. You need to make fishing rod, but the rod is about two pixels and easily missed if you aren't looking around the traffic robot.

-Orphan girl and Robot care giver

As mentioned before, it is very similar to _Monkey Island_.
You click somewhere, the character will go there slowly until you realize how to run.
If you click on something, you can interact with it and store it in your inventory so you can use it on other stuff to make other stuff to progress.
There are also a variety of characters, like a robot in denial about his job, or a fortune teller who tells you about the game after the Kickstarter.
Depending on which character you play as, they will react differently to the character, like a robot might speak binary if you are the little girl, but not the robot.

-Main Intersection

The game is aware that it is a game, an unfinished one in in fact.
It will not hesitate to turn to you, give you puppy eyes, and tell you to support their Kickstarter (whether it is in the final version, I don't know, might get back in a few weeks).
As well as that, an easter egg appears that changes the resolution comparable to Monkey Island and the characters mention it in a line and move on.
It also references other movies OTHER than _Blade Runner_, Kurt Russell's character from _Escape from New York_ makes an appearance as an older version of himself.
As well as that it shows a poster of a political candidate that has a similar name to an American Politician running for re-election, and both characters are quick to say how they hope they lose.

### Final Thoughts

-Inventory

I thought the demo was good, I don't think it will be winning many awards, but it does have potential.
Characters are something I haven't seen in the real world with girls her age would do and the characters have a unique design.
World building is subtle if you go through the characters inventory or seen Blade Runner.
I did have a few chuckles during some lines of dialogue, but not much thought provoking.

However, for me at least, the game seems to lag behind in a way where I thought it was going to crash during dialogue.
Also, it seems to rely on references in this game.
Remember when I said I chuckled a few times, it was mainly because they were references that I was aware of, but how many people will understand the _CD Projekt Red_ reference without knowing any of their games.
Maybe this is a personal thought, but they are really trying to release it today and gain popularity within the first few months while _CD Projekt Red_ is making RPGs or making politicians relevant, and I don't think a game or other forms of media should do that.
If you would like to know more on why, you can always support my [Kickstarter](https://sites.google.com/site/whydidyouclickonthelink/) (please, college doesn't pay for itself and I need all the help I can get).
