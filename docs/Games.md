This page is dedicated to games I made and have published on itch.io or elsewhere, with some insight as well.

###Time Tether

This is the first game I published anywhere.
I like to think of it as a tech demo in a way, since it is short and I was just experimenting.
It started out as a souls-like game originally, where you don't level up the same way as you would in other games.
I ran into a small problem, the prices never went up as you bought upgrades for the character, leading the player to just stay in the same position and grind the main area.

I recalled a web game from years ago where you have only a few seconds, and as you collect coins, you can purchase upgrades or more time so you can progress further.
I forget the name of the game and would recommend it if anyone can find it.
