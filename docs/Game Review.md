## [Encodya](https://chaosmonger.itch.io/encodya)

Encodya is what happens when you let early Lucasarts make Blade Runner instead of the Monkey Island games. 
It is made by an Indie studio called [Chaosmonger Studio](http://www.chaosmonger.com/), known for making movies, always good to branch out, but it all comes down to if it is good.
At the time of writing this, only the demo was available, but it is suppose to be released on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1137450/Encodya/) and [Gog.com](https://www.gog.com/game/encodya) on January 26, 2021.
So this review is only what the demo has to offer, is it unfair to judge something by 30 minutes, maybe but I need a grade.

## Overview

You play as a young orphaned girl and her robot caregiver in Neo-Berlin, 2062.
The world is very similar to Philip K. Dick's popular works, but is really eyeing Blade Runner in particular.
You have to find a way to get a bus ticket in the place the last bus dropped you off at.
I don't want to spoil much else because that is about it and say it's worth experiencing for yourself.
Before you click the buy button though you may want to finish reading the review, or don't, I can't stop you.

## Gameplay

As mentioned before, it is very similar to Monkey Island.
You click somewhere, the character will go there slowly until you realize how to run.
