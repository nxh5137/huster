## [_Encodya Demo_](https://chaosmonger.itch.io/encodya)

![encodya](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34407859/101263142-1ae32e80-3711-11eb-8bdf-4fd620634eef.jpg)

_Encodya_ is what happens when you let early _Lucasarts_ make _Blade Runner_ instead of the _Monkey Island_ games. 
It is made by an Indie studio called [_Chaosmonger Studio_](http://www.chaosmonger.com/), known for making movies, always good to branch out, but it all comes down to if it is good.
At the time of writing this, only the demo was available, but it is suppose to be released on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1137450/Encodya/) and [Gog.com](https://www.gog.com/game/encodya) on January 26, 2021.
So this review is only what the demo has to offer, is it unfair to judge something by 30 minutes, maybe but I need a grade.

### Overview

You play as a young orphaned girl and her robot caregiver in Neo-Berlin, 2062.
The world is very similar to Philip K. Dick's popular works, but is really eyeing _Blade Runner_ in particular.
You have to find a way to get a bus ticket in the place the last bus dropped you off at.
How would you do this you might ask, simple, you make the little girl collect a fingerprint from a nearby criminal.
You also need to fish a credit card from the sewer, and this is the only time I can say I got stuck. You need to make fishing rod, but the rod is about two pixels and easily missed if you aren't looking around the traffic robot.

-Orphan girl and Robot care giver

As mentioned before, it is very similar to _Monkey Island_.
You click somewhere, the character will go there slowly until you realize how to run.
If you click on something, you can interact with it and store it in your inventory so you can use it on other stuff to make other stuff to progress.
There are also a variety of characters, like a robot in denial about his job, or a fortune teller who tells you about the game after the Kickstarter.
Depending on which character you play as, they will react differently to the character, like a robot might speak binary if you are the little girl, but not the robot.

-Main Intersection

The game is aware that it is a game, an unfinished one in in fact.
It will not hesitate to turn to you, give you puppy eyes, and tell you to support their Kickstarter (whether it is in the final version, I don't know, might get back in a few weeks).
As well as that, an easter egg appears that changes the resolution comparable to Monkey Island and the characters mention it in a line and move on.
It also references other movies OTHER than _Blade Runner_, Kurt Russell's character from _Escape from New York_ makes an appearance as an older version of himself.
As well as that it shows a poster of a political candidate that has a similar name to an American Politician running for re-election, and both characters are quick to say how they hope they lose.

### Final Thoughts

-Inventory

I thought the demo was good, I don't think it will be winning many awards, but it does have potential.
Characters are something I haven't seen in the real world with girls her age would do and the characters have a unique design.
World building is subtle if you go through the characters inventory or seen Blade Runner.
I did have a few chuckles during some lines of dialogue, but not much thought provoking.

However, for me at least, the game seems to lag behind in a way where I thought it was going to crash during dialogue.
Also, it seems to rely on references in this game.
Remember when I said I chuckled a few times, it was mainly because they were references that I was aware of, but how many people will understand the _CD Projekt Red_ reference without knowing any of their games.
Maybe this is a personal thought, but they are really trying to release it today and gain popularity within the first few months while _CD Projekt Red_ is making RPGs or making politicians relevant, and I don't think a game or other forms of media should do that.
If you would like to know more on why, you can always support my [Kickstarter](https://sites.google.com/site/whydidyouclickonthelink/) (please, college doesn't pay for itself and I need all the help I can get).

## [_Aurore_](https://reverie-forge.itch.io/aurore)

![aurore pic](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34407859/101702164-5a31b800-3a4e-11eb-97f2-9acce1e08ef9.png)

_Aurore_ is a much different than Encodya, so if you were not fond of that you might want to give this one a try. 
It is not a long, should only take you about 30 minutes to complete.
It was made by only nine students in only two and a half months, and that is pretty impressive for obvious reasons I will be discussing, so stick around.

### Overview

While on a train ride, a person starts dreaming of another world.
You play as her dream self who looks as if she is leaving some sort of rave.
She really does stick out like a sore thumb, but it does benefit the game in this case in contrast of the light pink background.
You explore the world quite linear, which looks like a model train set frozen at the moment Godzilla showed up.
That being said, you can branch out a little and get collectibles.

-The world of _Aurore_

In this game, you get around by changing the size of certain objects.
How do you know what can be changed, simple really, It will be highlighted blue.
You can change the size by holding the right/left mouse button.
The object you are changing can only become so big/small, so no hopes in trying to change the size of Mount Everest to the size of an atom.
As you progress through the game, some of the objects are spring loaded or change weight when you change the size.

-Objects that can be changed

Besides those objects, you can collect things called memories.
These look like as though they were created with shattered stain glass by a five year old with tape.
Some are quite easy to find, but a bit out of the way, whereas others I couldn'tget to without getting a slap on the wrist for wanting to explore more.
I was not dedicated enough to go out of my way to get them because the frame rate drop faster than an art exhibit in an M5 earthquake and made the 3D platforming almost abysmal.
I am willing to forgive this though since my computer is ~5 years old running on parts older than the day I built it.

-Memory

The game does not talk about real problems because it does not need to.
The whole point is that it is a dream, an escape from the real world.
The game is aware that it's a dream, since at the beginning and the end of the game, you are awake in the real world.
A little easter egg is that if you pause the game, you blink into the real world still on the train and fade back after you resume the game.

-_Aurore_ menu screen

While I am aware that a called the game not that complex, the world-building is very subtle.
While you explore the world, you notice that the world has let gravity, from the characters movement to objects that are floating.
You may not take notice in it if you are playing casually your first playthrough, you might notice why your second after your second playthrough because you know how it ends.
If you know anything about space, then they ending will make sense.
At the end you notice that the moon is bigger than normal and you need to shrink it and once you do, the water levels start to lower revealing a building.

### Final Thoughts

The game is definetly an interesting game that takes up a big spot normally reserved for my plans in life and things I've studied for.
It has lead me to ask questions that I didn't ask in games such as _Encodya_, because not a single word is spoken.
Some questions include who is the girl, why is the church upside down, and a question that every game within a dream, was it a dream?
It is like the mechanics of [_Superliminal_](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1049410/Superliminal/) and the 3d platforming of _Banjo Kazooie_ were combined.
The mechanics were fun to play around with and was visually appealing, nothing that would make me ask which was real, but enough to say it looks good.
It is also the perfect length, short enough to play if you are on a train ride, and not long enough to get bored with the mechanics.

However, the frame rate was low and I would miss the jump because I was still trying to figure out where I was going to land with the frames messing with me.
I probably would've speed ran it in 20 minutes or something if it weren't for that.
Overall, I would like to congratulte the small team of developers for creating this game.
