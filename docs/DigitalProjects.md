## Raspberry Pi
I have worked on a raspberry since I was in high school when they gave it to me so I can teach the teachers things that they could do with it. So far I have made it an entertainment center that can play both movies and games, manage to code some music with it, as well make a voice kit that acts that a Google home, which you can see here.

## Car Modifications
Earlier this year, when I got a used car, it did not have a backup camera, so I have ordered a backup camera and installed a screen up front, bringing it to the modern-day… as long as you look at it on the inside.

## Amazon Firestick
Before I had a job, I use to upgrade my mom’s coworkers Firestick for a small price, it didn’t stop at them though, but I soon ended up doing it for family and friends soon after.

## Ham Radio Operator
While not as digital as the others on this list, I thought I would bring up how I am a Ham radio operator and been wondering how to progress since I only have an amateurs license.

## Computers and Laptops
I built my first computer a few years ago and currently looking to build another one in the future.

A few years later, I job shadowed a company and learned how to repair laptops. I have many laptops around my room that are operational and run smoothly for the most part.

## Websites
I have been making websites since high school through dream weaver that is now lost somewhere on the Internet. Now that I am in college though, I have made two websites, one on GitHub, and the other on WordPress, which I will link to below.
